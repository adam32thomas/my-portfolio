        <p class="content">
            I am a bootcamp student at The Ohio State University.  While I am just starting out as a coder, my career has covered a diverse list of skills and 
            experiences over the past 24 years.  At 17 I graduated High School and joined the United States Army as a Human Resources Specialist.  For twenty years
            I deployed all over the world and trained in both outdoor and classroom environments on leadership, information technology, human resources, static line 
            parachute performance, small arms marksmanship and dozens of other related skills.

            Since retiring from the military I have focused on IT and Administrative/Management skills.  I have been working for three years at TekSynap, a government 
            contractor that specializes in emerging technologies and IT/Cyber support to various federal government agencies and other clients.  In my current role I 
            am the Project Coordintor for a Network Engineering team that works hand in hand with Cisco, Juniper, AT&T and other companies to provide quality WiFi 
            coverage to Veterans Hospitals and Clinics from coast to coast.
